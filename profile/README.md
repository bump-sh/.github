Bump allows you to easily **generate your API documentation and API changelog**.

From an [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) or [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification, you can deploy your **API documentation in a couple of minutes**. You can customize your documentation UI (title, colors, menu), protect it with a password, and customize its URL with your own domain.

Share a link to your documentation with your API consumers and help them to never miss an API change again. They will have the possibility to **track API structural changes** if they subscribe by email. Once a week, subscribers will receive a changelog digest of your documentation if your API has changed. Curious? Here is the API [documentation changelog](https://developers.bump.sh/changes) of our own API.

To make the most out of Bump, we suggest integrating our tool in your development process. We offer a [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/blob/master/package.json) and [Continuous Integration](https://help.bump.sh/continuous-integration) examples to let you: view API diff during code review thanks to our [Github Action](https://github.com/bump-sh/github-action), Bump will automatically **comment your pull requests with changes digest**, then once merged we will **deploy your changes** directly to your documentation page.

If you work in a multiple services environment and have many different APIs, we got you covered. You can organize and mix your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI based documentations in a developer Hub. You will thus have **all of your APIs listed in one place**. Check our [demo “Train company” hub](https://demo.bump.sh/) for a live example.
